Builder pattern in nutshell:
    - Each method returns the object reference it's called from,
    - Build method returns fully constructed object,
    - Functionality can be combined into one class,

Why use this pattern?
    - useful when object creation has many parameters,
    - Becomes increasingly more useful when some or all parameters are optional,
    - Can make code easier to read because of reduced lines of construction
      when compared with setters.
