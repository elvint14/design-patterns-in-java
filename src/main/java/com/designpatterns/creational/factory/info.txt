Factory in nutshell:
    - Factory allows constructions of similar classes of different types using a factory method,
    - Method call creates an object for you and serves it back,
    - Constructed objects are from classes that share an interface or parent class.

Why use this pattern?
    - Allows you to not worry about class construction in more than one place,
    - Allows you to leverage the interface for repetitive operations,
    - lack of construction in your code cleans up code and aslo make copy-paste errors less likely.
