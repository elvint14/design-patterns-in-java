Proxy Pattern in a Nutshell:
    - Use of a intermediary object in place of a real object,
    - Intermediary protects the real object,
    - Intermediary controls the instantiation of the real object,
    - Intermediary can add behaviour to real object.

Why use this pattern?
    - Expensive operations need to be protected and only called when needed,
    - Behaviour needs to be added to a method when it is called in specific operations,
    - Remove object access.
