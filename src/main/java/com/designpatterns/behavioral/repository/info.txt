Repository Pattern in a Nutshell:
    - Not a GoF pattern, but was introduced in Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans,
    - Simple operations of an entity or business object without knowledge of other entities (DAO),
    - Under the abstraction, the data access operations are hidden.

Why use this pattern?
    - Databases have become the bottleneck,
    - Prevent data access logic from leaking into your business logic,
    - Provide a layer of abstraction to hide internals,
    - Focus on single business objects at a time.
